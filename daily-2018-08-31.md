the hunt puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberry saw "a large cat " only five yard from her, it immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confimed that a pume will not attack a human being unless cornered. the search proved difficult, for the puma was ofen observed at one place in the morning and at another twenty miles away in the evening. wherever it went, it left behind a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes.Several people complained of 'cat like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree , The exports were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country. this one must have been in possession of private collector, and somehow managed to escape. the hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught,It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.<br>
